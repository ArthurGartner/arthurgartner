## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Arthur
I am a software engineer completing a Masters of Science (M.S.) in Computer and Information Sciences while continuing to build my technical skillset. When not at work or school I am usually working on side coding projects that solve real world problems and make atleast one other person's life easier. Away from the computer I take advantage of the local Charleston area and weather by sailing, going to the beach and taking motorcycle rides along the coast.

## ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on
I enjoy the challenge of solving a problem. Every side project I start begins with an analysis of how to solve a particular problem. I additionally approach each side project with a desire to learn a new language, framework or system design. These challenges keep me sharp and give me the benefit of learning while working.

As of **April 2022** my current side project is a workplace platform for employee and asset management called **magemanaged**. The repos for this project can be found in my pinned repos.<br>
